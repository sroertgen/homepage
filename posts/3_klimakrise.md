He used the theme [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) and wrote the page [ directly in HTML ](https://github.com/oerhoernchen/klimakriseschnelldurchlauf/blob/master/index.html).

Since I'm currently beginning to learn React and Gatsby, I decided to take the opportunity and convert this project to a Gatsby project. So here is, what I did:

## What is Gatsby?

First of all [ Gatsby ](https://gatsbyks.org) is a site generator for React. But why not build directly in React? Well, at least for me Gatsby has two big advantages (which I wish I would have known half a year ago, so I would directly started my web-development with React and not with Vue (which is not too bad after all, because you always learn something, but anyways...)):

  - it comes with a well working static site generator, so one can easily deploy pages on GitHub, GitLab, Netlify and so on
  - you can pull your data just from anywhere you want
  
I think the first point is easy to understand, but what does the second exactly mean?
Gatsby uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to retrieve the data your website is built from.
So you probably heard of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (written in Ruby) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (written in Go) to built static websites.
Mostly you have a predefined project structure to where to put your markdown documents and then your site gets build from that.
This is working great and perfect for a lot of use-cases, but let's be honest: Do you really want to dive in Ruby or Go?
At least me not, I'm happy with my Javascript, my (needing to develop) React skills and do not want to learn another language for building static sites (at least not yet).

So that is why I decided to give Gatsby a go, since I can live in the JS world and get my data in the website with GraphQL. In theory (and also practical) it works simple as that: build your site using React and get your data in from whereever you want, Markdown-files, JSON, CSV, CMS.
Of course one has to learn a bit GraphQL, but the use-cases really look promising. 


## Rebuilding of klimakrise

So what did I do? At first I went to the Gatsby starter library and luckily saw that there is already a Gatsby starter template for [HTML5 UP](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?c=HTML5UP&v=2).

So I went for the [ same as Matthias did ](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-directive/) and simply used the given command to clone it:

```shell
gatsby new gatsby-starter-directive https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-directive
```

We simply need an index page and that's where I want to put all the content from my Markdown file.

So first Gatsby has to know, where to look for the markdown file. In the Gatsby ecosystem there is a plugin for everything. The corresponfing plugin to look for a file is called [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=). We install it like mentioned and add it to our `gatsby-config.js`, where all the plugins are managed like this:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
  path: `${__dirname}/src/markdown`,
  name: "markdown",
  },
},
```

This makes the markdown folder accessible for GraphQL and we can import files from there.
We also need to import a Markdown parser, so our File gets converted into HTML.
Since we will also work with pictures and iframes in our Markdown-file, we will the respectuve plugins as well, so our `gatsby-config.js`, will also have to include these plugins:

- [Gatsby-Transformer-Remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/?=transformer) for converting Markdown to HTML
- [gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe/?=gatsby%20remark%20iframe) for having nice responsive iframes
- [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby%20remark%20imag) for responsive images

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
{
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
        plugins: [
            `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`,
            {
                resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
                options: {
                    maxWidth: 800,
                    linkImagesToOriginal: true,
                },
            },
        ], 
    },
},

```

So we got our data, markdown parser and are able to work with images.
Let's jump right to the `index.js` and modify it the following way to get the data from a GraphQL query and implement it in our HTML:


```javascript
import React from 'react';

import Layout from '../components/Layout';
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import Header from '../components/Header';
import Footer from '../components/Footer';


const IndexPage = ({data}) => {
    return (
        <Layout>
          <Header />

          <div id="main">
            <header className="major container medium">
              {data.markdownRemark.frontmatter.title}
            </header>
            <div className="box container">
            <div
              dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: data.markdownRemark.html }}
            />
            </div>
          </div>
          <Footer />
        </Layout>
    )
}

export default IndexPage

export const pageQuery = graphql`
query IndexPageQuery {
    markdownRemark(fileAbsolutePath: {regex: "/index.md/"}) {
        id
        frontmatter {
        title
        }
        html
  }
}
`
```

So what did I do?

First I imported GraphQL to use it for my query.

I added the data object to the IndexPage so I can use it there.

But where does it come from? The data object is returned by the pageQuery at the end of the file: 

```javascript
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query IndexPageQuery {
  markdownRemark(fileAbsolutePath: {regex: "/index.md/"}) {
    id
    frontmatter {
      title
    }
    html
  }
}
`
```

This is basically looking for the index.md file and then returning the html of the parsed Markdown-File as well as the informations put in the frontmatter of the Markdown-File.

We can then use this information in the HTML by using simple dot notation on the data object.

I further modified the Footer a little bit and removed some elements.
Last I edited the `config.js` and added the correct heading, subHeading as well as socialLinks and that's basically it.
