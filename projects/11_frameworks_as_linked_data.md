# OEH-Linked-Frameworks

This is some little SPARQL-App for visualizing framework data modelled in RDF (see below for more info on the model). It is going to be used for demo purposes. It's as always quite alpha and might have some bugs, but developing a sparql-based react app is actually quite fun. See the Blog-Post or readme in repo for more information.
